            <h2>Jess</h2>
            <p>As a widowed, single mother, depending on the state to help feed her boys was not working. She worked 
            two low-paying jobs to make ends meet. But, after speaking to one of our representative at her night job, 
            Jess was able to finish up her degree in Criminal Justice. She is now on track to becoming a divorce attorney.</p>

            <h2>Kimberly</h2>
            <p>Kim was a senior high school student with aspirations of attending Harvard University. She maintained a 3.6GPA throughout high school, but it was hard to keep up due to her constant admittance into Sickle Cell Crisis. 
              She thought there would be no way to get accepted into Harvard University, let alone afford it. After working with one of our represenatives, she recieved the "Women of Color In Need Grant" from ColourPOP Inc.
               In return, she was able to attend any college or university of her choice without the debt.  </p>
